# A Pokemon Minigame Project

This project is currently still underway.

I am using the NextJS framework to design this project as a way to learn and deploy an app for fun with NextJS.

The project will be that you throw a pokeball, and it will spawn a random pokemon from the publicly accessible API at [HERE](https://pokeapi.co/)

The page will then display the pokemon with its name, picture and other stats in a pokedex like display.

I will also add a section with localstorage? (Haven't thought about this idea completely, as to whether or not I want to add authentication) that will allow users to see all the pokemon they've spawned.
